READ ME:  
For server start, use the following instructions:  
-Prior to start, ensure you have the latest version of NodeJS installed.  
-Ensure you have all dependencies. To do this, go to 'package.json' and open it in a text editor. Open a terminal and 'cd' navigate to the project folder. Type 'npm install ###' with '###' being the name of each dependency, do this for all of them.  
-Ensure you know the system's local-to-the-network IP address. (the domain if webhosted)  

1. Either use the Windows shortcut or, in the terminal, type 'nodemon' if you have it installed or 'node main' if you don't.
2. Navigate to either 127.0.0.1:8080 locally or [THE IP OF THE SYSTEM]:8080 to view the site.  

#NOTE: If something happens to fail, go to the terminal window (inspect error if you wish to) and then type 'rs' (the Node Monitor command for 'restart server'), then, go back to a point prior to the error occurring.
