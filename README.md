READ ME:  
For server start, use the following instructions:  
-Prior to start, ensure you have the latest version of NodeJS installed.  
-Ensure you have all dependencies. To do this, go to the terminal that is 'cd'-ed into the project directory and type 'npm install'.  
ALTERNATIVELY: If that does not work, type 'npm install ###' with '###' being the name of each dependency listed in the package.json file, do this for all of them.  
-Ensure you know the system's local-to-the-network IP address. (the domain if webhosted)  

1. Either use the Windows shortcut or, in the terminal 'cd'-ed into the project directory, type 'node main'.  
2. Navigate to either 127.0.0.1:8080 locally or [THE IP OF THE SYSTEM]:8080 to view the site.  

#NOTE: If something happens to fail, go to the terminal window (inspect error if you wish to) and either exit out of the server terminal or hit 'ctrl+c' twice. Then restart from step 1.
